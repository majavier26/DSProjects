This folder contains all of the notebooks I created from doing this project. Its goal is to essentially predict the climate types in the Philippines by learning from weather data. The data ranges from March 2021 to August 2024 and has four variables, maximum and mimum temperature, rainfall, and wind speed over >390 cities in the Philippines. I then executed principal component analysis to reduce the variables to 3, and did time series analysis to group each time series into clusters.
