[!] This project is a WIP. 

This folder includes all of the notebooks I created to try and predict the path of typhoons. The principle is that by compiling all of the paths and properties of the typhoons from 1985 to present in the Northwestern Pacific, by supplying an initial condition of a typhoon: datetime Y0/M0/D0 H0:m0:s0, coordinates x0 and y0, radius r0, pressure P0, wind speed v0, wind gust u0, we can predict how the typhoon can evolve over time.
