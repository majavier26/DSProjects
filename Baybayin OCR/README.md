[!] This project is a WIP.

This folder contains all of the notebooks I created for this project. It aims to romanize Baybayin text from an image by using machine learning. The idea is to cut the image into several pieces and to analyze each of them. It will be validated by comparing how close the romanized text to its actual romanization and/or dictionary counterpart.
